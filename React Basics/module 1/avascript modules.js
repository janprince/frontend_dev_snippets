/**
 * In JavaScript, a module is simply a file.
 * 
 * The purpose of a module is to have more modular code, where you can work with smaller files, and import and export them so that the apps you 
 * build are more customizable and have more composable parts.
 * 
 * A module can be as simple as a single function in a separate file.
 * 
 * How would you make this file a JavaScript module?
 * All that you would need to do to make it a JavaScript module is use the export syntax.
 * 
 * Well, in React, you can make use of this JavaScript feature to separate your components by placing them in their own file. 
 * Then you can use the import and export statements to make the files communicate with each other. 
 * The export statement is used to make a module available to another module. It helps to think of every JavaScript file as a module. 
 * Then in order to make the functions and variables available to other files, you need to export them, which makes them available by the import statement.
 * 
 * In JavaScript, there are two types of exports, default exports and named exports. 
 * The default export is used when the function name is the same as the file name and named exports are used when you want the function name to be different from the file name.

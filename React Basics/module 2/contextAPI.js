/**
 * While passing props helps to manage states, it is like taking a bus and going through each stop before you get off at the end. In comparison, using the context API is like teleporting to your destination instantly. 
 * It's a way to bypass the redundant passing of data through multiple levels of components.
 * 
 * 
 * To set it up, you need to add a piece of code that will be your context provider.
 * It's also where the state will be stored. When a component needs to use the state, it becomes a context consumer.

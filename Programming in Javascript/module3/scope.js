// Scope is all about code accessibility.

/**
 * the code that exists outside of a function is referred to as global scope, and 
 * all the code inside of a function is known as local scope or function scope. 
 * 
 * If a variable is defined within a function, then you can say it's scoped to that function. 
 * This is also known as local scope
